There once was a woman named Jessica. She's a food lover and wants to try the famous cheese curds of Wisconsin. So she decided to gather her items, her pet monkey, Seamus, and began her journey to the great state of Wisconsin. 
Jessica's first stop on her mission to find the best cheese curds was the farmer's market here in Madison. Jessica decided, after reviewing several different types of cheese curds that the next stop on her journey should be a restaurant. 
Jessica decided to go to Old Fashioned. She ordered the cheese curds there, which are rumoured to have been the best cheese curds in Wisconsin. When she ate them, she felt like her mouth was going to explode from joy. It was so mouthwatering good, that she ended up putting 2 more orders of the cheese curds to take back home.
Jessica furthering pondering how good the cheese curds were decided to order 2000 more orders. She had to dip into her retirement savings to be able to afford all the food. It took the restaurant 7 days to complete the order, but the day had finally arrived. Jessica had ordered a budget truck to hold all of the cheese curds, and began her journey home.
